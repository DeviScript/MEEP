            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <h3>Our Mission - HELIOS</h3>
            <p>The mission has been christened "HELIOS" â€“ Habitable Exoplanetary Life Inspection & Orbital Studies. This
                name
                reflects the dual nature of our mission: to inspect the habitability of Proxima Centauri b and to
                perform
                comprehensive orbital studies of the planet.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitable:</strong> Focusing on the central question of the planet's potential to support
                    life.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exoplanetary:</strong> Signifying that our mission extends beyond our own solar system to an
                    exoplanet.</li>
                <li><strong>Life Inspection:</strong> Reflecting the search for life, one of the most profound
                    scientific
                    quests
                    of our time.</li>
                <li><strong>Orbital Studies:</strong> Highlighting the methodical observation and analysis from orbit
                    that
                    will
                    shed light on the planet's characteristics.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The name HELIOS also evokes the image of the Sun god in Greek mythology, symbolizing the light we aim to
                shed
                on
                the unknown aspects of Proxima Centauri b. It encapsulates a mission of discovery, illumination, and the
                quest
                for knowledge beyond our solar reaches. We are passionate about space exploration and committed to
                unraveling the mysteries of Proxima Centauri b.
                Together, we are pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and venturing into the cosmos.</p>
