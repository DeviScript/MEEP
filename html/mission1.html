        <h2>Exploring the Mysteries of Proxima Centauri b</h2>

        <h3>Mission Overview</h3>
        <p>Mission, codenamed "Proxima Quest," is a groundbreaking space exploration mission designed to investigate
            Proxima Centauri b, a potentially habitable exoplanet located in the habitable zone of the Proxima Centauri
            star system. This mission aims to unravel the mysteries of this Earth-like world and provide valuable
            insights into the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.</p>

        <h3>World Selection Details</h3>
        <ul class="details-list">

            <strong>Star: Proxima Centauri</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Proxima Centauri is the closest known star to the Sun, at approximately 4.24 light-years away,
                    making it a prime target for interstellar exploration.</li>
                <li>It is a red dwarf star, which means it is smaller and cooler than the Sun. Red dwarfs are the
                    most common type of star in the Milky Way, which makes understanding their planetary systems
                    crucial for a broader understanding of our galaxy.</li>
                <li>Despite its proximity, the star poses significant challenges for potential habitability due to
                    its activity, including frequent stellar flares that can be much more intense than the Sun's.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Planet: Proxima Centauri b</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Proxima Centauri b is an exoplanet located in the habitable zone of its star, where conditions
                    might be right for liquid water to exist on its surface.</li>
                <li>The planet is roughly Earth-sized, which suggests a terrestrial composition with the potential
                    for a rocky surface.</li>
                <li>Little is known about its atmosphere, surface conditions, or whether any form of water or life
                    exists.</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>


        <h3>Scientific Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our mission aims to discover whether Proxima Centauri b has an atmosphere and, if so, to analyze its
                composition.</li>
            <li>We seek to characterize the planet's surface conditions, including temperature, pressure, and geological
                features.</li>
            <li>We will investigate the presence of liquid water in any form, which is a fundamental precursor for life
                as we know it.</li>
            <li>Lastly, we will search for any biochemical signatures that could indicate the presence of microbial
                life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mission Instruments</h3>
        <p>Proxima Quest is equipped with advanced scientific instruments, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spectroscopy devices to analyze the planet's atmosphere and chemical composition.</li>
            <li>High-resolution cameras for capturing detailed images of the exoplanet's surface.</li>
            <li>Robotic landers and rovers for in-situ exploration and sample collection.</li>
            <li>Telescopes for long-range observations of the Proxima Centauri star system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Significance for Astronomy</h3>
        <p>This mission holds immense significance for the field of astronomy and astrobiology. If successful, it could
            provide answers to fundamental questions about the potential for life beyond Earth and the conditions
            required for habitability on exoplanets. The data and discoveries from Proxima Quest will shape our
            understanding of planetary science and guide future missions to explore the cosmos.</p>
